# Simple Canvas App

This project provides a minimal responsive web app with a fixed 700x700 canvas. Users can switch between preset images using arrow buttons or the keyboard and zoom the image without changing the canvas size. The toolbar lets you upload custom images and add multiple text layers over the canvas. A panel on the right shows every image or text layer in order.

## Files
- `index.html` – main HTML page
- `styles.css` – styles for responsive design
- `script.js` – handles images, text layers, zoom and layer management

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a web browser. The layout adjusts for mobile and desktop screens. Use the arrow buttons or left/right arrow keys to change images. Use the plus and minus buttons to zoom in or out. The layer panel on the right lists each layer and highlights the active image.
