# Simple Canvas App

This project provides a minimal responsive web app with a fixed 700x700 canvas. Users can switch between preset images using arrow buttons or the keyboard and zoom the image without changing the canvas size. The toolbar lets you upload custom images and display text over the canvas.

## Files
- `index.html` – main HTML page
- `styles.css` – styles for responsive design
- `script.js` – handles changing images and zoom functionality

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a web browser. The layout adjusts for mobile and desktop screens. Use the arrow buttons or left/right arrow keys to change images. Use the plus and minus buttons to zoom in or out.
